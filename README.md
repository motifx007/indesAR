# indesAR - Interior Design Simulation using Augmented Reality, 2019

## About

>In this project report, we present a simulation application for making the process of selection
>of furniture and other interior design components more efficient. The application basically
>understands the plains (vertical/horizontal) and decides the area over which the required component’s
>3D model is augmented, as seen through the user’s mobile device’s camera. The
>application involves basic operations in computer graphics like Translation, Rotation and Scaling.

>This application avoids the case where the customer has to buy the component, transport
>it to the exact location and then check how well it suits with the surroundings, which may
>sometimes not go well, in which case they have to return the component back (this wastes a lot
>of time and effort). Hence the project on implementation helps reduce these inconveniences and
>unnecessary troubles caused during selection of 40 interior design components like Furniture,
>Wall shelves, Ceiling decorations, etc.
